  BACKROUND: 
  given a data file of people (in format of: <name> <id> <age>) and one person sith the keyword SICK after his age
  given a data file of meetings (in format of: <id1> <id2> <distance> <measure>)
  the program calculates an infection tree according to a certain formula and the meetings in the meetings file and outputs a file specifying the
  probability for every person to get sick and wether he/she needs to be Hospitalized, to in Quarantine or No-Treatment required
  the variable of the formula can be changed through constants.h file

  
  
ASSUMPTIONS: I worked under some validity assumptions that the input files are valid and in the correct format
